This is a sample Java project that shows how you can use Gradle to build and run the TestNG tests.  You will just need Gradle locally to run on the command line and Groovy if you will be running in an IDE.

Feel free to remove pieces you don't need, mainly TestNG and reporting output.

To initialize your project just run:

``gradle init
``

This will initialize a new Gradle build and will auto-generate build.gradle, settings.gradle, gradlew, gradlew.bat and the gradle wrappers.

## Requirements
- [Gradle 1.11] (http://www.gradle.org)
- [Groovy 2.2] (http://http://groovy.codehaus.org)
- Java 1.7+
